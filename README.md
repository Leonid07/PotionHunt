A game about resource gathering and potion crafting that can be sold.
There are several locations with their own levels. Each location has unique resources that can be collected. There are obstacles like dragons and time limits for gathering resources.
Resources can be sold directly or used to craft potions, which can then be sold.
The currency in the potion brewing section is resources. For example, to make a luck potion, you need a specific set of resources.
